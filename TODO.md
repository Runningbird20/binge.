# TODO

Ideas for binge., roughly in priority order. Each item names the files to start from.

## Features

- [ ] **"Forgot PIN?"** on the lock screen: confirm the account password, then clear or reset the PIN (`ProfileSecurityDialog.js`; `set_profile_lock` already supports removing it).
- [ ] **Watch party / shared queue.** `profile_shares` already sends titles between profiles in an account; a "watch together" link that syncs play/pause through Supabase Realtime would build on it.
- [ ] **Smarter "Because you watched"** (on hold until binge. has enough users with overlapping ratings). Mix in the existing `collaborative_*_candidates` RPCs ("people who liked X also liked") as a lightly weighted extra source next to TMDB `/recommendations` (which already covers this from TMDB's audience) in `src/utils/personalization.js`.
- [ ] **Reading progress across devices.** `BookReader.js` keeps your place in `localStorage` (`binge:reader-progress`), so it doesn't follow the profile to another device. Save it per profile in Supabase, like `continue_watching.position_seconds`.
- [ ] **"Surprise me."** A button on Home and Movies/Series that picks one title from the profile's top recommendations (`buildPersonalizedRows`), respecting the release window and maturity level, and opens or plays it.
- [ ] **Search filters.** `/search` (`SearchResults.js`) has no way to narrow results. Add chips for type, decade and language (`role="group"` + `aria-pressed`, like the genre chips), applied to both catalog results and Ask binge.
- [ ] **Sleep timer on the website.** The TV apps have one (`PlayerModel.swift`, `PlayerModel.kt`); the web player doesn't. "End of episode / 30 / 60 min" in `PlaybackOptions.js`, pausing via the same position save as closing the player.

## UI and UX

- [ ] **Spoiler-safe episode lists.** Episode stills and summaries further ahead than your next episode give plot away. Blur those stills and hide those summaries until tapped, with a switch in Settings (`MediaDetailsModal.js`, `profileSettings.js`).
- [ ] **"Install binge." prompt.** The site is a PWA (manifest, service worker, shortcuts), but nothing handles `beforeinstallprompt`, so most people never install it. Offer Install in the Me sheet / Settings on Chrome and Android, and an "Add to Home Screen" how-to sheet on iPhone.
- [ ] **Link previews for shared titles.** `/movie/:id`, `/tv-show/:id` and `/book/:id` are rendered in the browser, so iMessage, Discord and Slack show the generic site card. Serve `og:title` / `og:description` / `og:image` (the TMDB backdrop) for those paths from a small Vercel function before the app loads.
- [ ] **Notification inbox.** New-episode, reminder, game and admin push alerts disappear once dismissed, and nothing in the app lists them. Add a bell in the navbar with the last 30 days of alerts (one table both crons write to), with unread dots.

## Tests and reliability

- [ ] **Unit tests for the untested utils.** 42 of 64 `src/utils` modules have no test file. Start with logic that silently changes what users see: `catalogLookup`, `browseRows`, `continueWatching`, `kidsMode`, `releaseCalendar`, `playbackPositions`, `newEpisodes`.
- [ ] **An E2E check for the database split.** Signed in, open Home and assert rows have titles: this would have caught the empty preview (`e2e/`, needs `E2E_EMAIL`/`E2E_PASSWORD`).
- [ ] **E2E for profile PINs** (set PIN → switch away → wrong PIN → right PIN) once a test account exists.
- [ ] **Watch `/api/neon-data` in production.** Log slow queries and errors to `error_events` so a broken catalog shows on `/admin` instead of as silently empty rows.

## Mobile

- [ ] Andriod APK
- [ ] Apple ipa
